## ✨ Features

- Scrape subtitles from Apple TV and iTunes movies you own or have rented.
- Retrieve the expected streaming release date (if available) for unreleased movies.
- Utilize asynchronous downloading to speed up the download of chunked subtitles.
- Automatically convert subtitles to SubRip (SRT) format.
- Fix right-to-left (RTL) alignment in RTL language subtitles automatically.
- Configure settings such as download folder, preferred languages, and toggling features.

> [!NOTE]
> Apple previously allowed Apple TV master playlists to be fetched without account entitlement. They are now restricted
> to Apple Accounts that own or have rented the movie.
> See [Issue #103](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/103) for more context.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```shell
pip install isubrip
```

### Usage

```shell
isubrip [--dsid DSID] <URL> [URL...]
```

Owned or rented content requires an Apple DSID. See [Apple DSID](#apple-dsid) for setup instructions.

> [!TIP]
> Run `isubrip --help` for all command-line options.

## 🛠 Configuration

A [TOML](https://toml.io) configuration file is optional.

iSubRip looks for the configuration file in the following location, based on your operating system:

- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.isubrip\config.toml`
- **Linux / macOS**: `$HOME/.isubrip/config.toml`

### Path Examples

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\Michael\.isubrip\config.toml`
- **Linux**: `/home/Michael/.isubrip/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `/Users/Michael/.isubrip/config.toml`


### Example Configuration

```toml
[downloads]
folder = "C:\\Subtitles\\AppleTV"
languages = ["en-US", "fr-FR", "he"]
zip = false

[subtitles]
convert-to-srt = true
fix-rtl = true

[subtitles.webvtt]
subrip-alignment-conversion = true

[scrapers.appletv]
dsid = "1234567890"
```

> [!TIP]
> An example config with details and explanations for all available settings can be found [here](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/blob/main/example-config.toml).

### Apple DSID

Apple requires account entitlement before HLS manifests of paid content can be loaded.
A DSID identifies the Apple account that owns or has rented the title.

#### Finding your DSID

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for locating or acquiring a DSID will not be provided.
> Please **do not** open issues requesting help with DSID acquisition.

Apple does not provide a documented way for third-party tools to look up a DSID.
You can try the following steps to find your DSID:

1. Sign in to [Apple TV's Billing page](https://tv.apple.com/account/billing) using the Apple Account that owns or has rented the movie. If prompted to add a payment method, you can skip it; no billing changes are required.
2. Open [ph2.tv.apple.com/settings](https://ph2.tv.apple.com/settings).
3. Locate the `dsId` key and copy its numeric value from the JSON response.

#### Configuring your DSID

Configure the DSID using one of the following methods. If multiple methods are configured, `--dsid` overrides the
`ISUBRIP_DSID` environment variable, which overrides `config.toml`.

The configuration file is recommended for regular use:

```toml
[scrapers.appletv]
dsid = "1234567890"
```

You can instead use an environment variable:

```shell
# Linux / macOS
export ISUBRIP_DSID="1234567890"

# Windows PowerShell
$env:ISUBRIP_DSID = "1234567890"
```

For a one-off run, you can use the command-line flag:

```shell
isubrip --dsid 1234567890 <URL>
```

> [!WARNING]
> The DSID is a numeric Apple account identifier.
> It is not a password or authentication cookie, but it is persistent, tied to your account, and should not be shared publicly.
>
> Command-line arguments may be saved in shell history or visible to other local processes. It is safer to configure
> the DSID using the environment variable or the configuration file.

#### DSID troubleshooting

- If the response from [ph2.tv.apple.com/settings](https://ph2.tv.apple.com/settings) contains `"message": "Sign-In Required"`, make sure you authenticated on the Apple TV Billing page, even if you are already signed in on the main Apple TV website.
- Confirm that the DSID belongs to the Apple account that owns the movie or has an active rental.
- An Apple HTTP 404 with a configured DSID can mean that the account is not entitled to that title, the rental expired, or Apple changed the manifest access flow.

## 📜 Logs
Log files are created for each run in the following paths, depending on your operating system:

**Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.isubrip\logs`  
**Linux / macOS**: `$HOME/.isubrip/logs`  

Log rotation (deletion of old files once a certain number of files is reached) can be configured in the configuration file using the `general.log-rotation-size` setting. The default value is `15`.

For more details, see the [example configuration](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/blob/main/example-config.toml).
